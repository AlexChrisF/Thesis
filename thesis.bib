@article{Ratner2017,
	abstract = {Data augmentation is a ubiquitous technique for increasing the size of labeled training sets by leveraging task-specific data transformations that preserve class labels. While it is often easy for domain experts to specify individual transformations, constructing and tuning the more sophisticated compositions typically needed to achieve state-of-the-art results is a time-consuming manual task in practice. We propose a method for automating this process by learning a generative sequence model over user-specified transformation functions using a generative adversarial approach. Our method can make use of arbitrary, non-deterministic transformation functions, is robust to misspecified user input, and is trained on unlabeled data. The learned transformation model can then be used to perform data augmentation for any end discriminative model. In our experiments, we show the efficacy of our approach on both image and text datasets, achieving improvements of 4.0 accuracy points on CIFAR-10, 1.4 F1 points on the ACE relation extraction task, and 3.4 accuracy points when using domain-specific transformation operations on a medical imaging dataset as compared to standard heuristic augmentation approaches.},

@article{Scheeder2018,
	abstract = {The increase in imaging throughput, new analytical frameworks and high-performance computational resources open new avenues for data-rich phenotypic profiling of small molecules in drug discovery. Image-based profiling assays assessing single-cell phenotypes have been used to explore mechanisms of action, target efficacy and toxicity of small molecules. Technological advances to generate large data sets together with new machine learning approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional profiling data create opportunities to improve many steps in drug discovery. In this review, we will discuss how recent studies applied machine learning approaches in functional profiling workflows with a focus on chemical genetics. While their utility in image-based screening and profiling is predictably evident, examples of novel insights beyond the status quo based on the applications of machine learning approaches are just beginning to emerge. To enable discoveries, future studies also need to develop methodologies that lower the entry barriers to high-throughput profiling experiments by streamlining image-based profiling assays and providing applications for advanced learning technologies such as easy to deploy deep neural networks.},
