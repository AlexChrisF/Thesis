\section{JavaScript}
There are a few big advantages offered by \textbf{\gls{JS}}.\\ Maybe the biggest advantage is that it comes with the web browser, so everybody can run it by simply typing in an \gls{URL}. This offers great possibilities, since the users don't have to install any software package. The provided application is immediately ready to use once it was loaded.

Today \gls{JS} is the most used programming language world wide (Picture: \ref{fig:JS}). \gls{JS} first appeared in 1995, originally developed at Netscape by Brendan Eich it had a simple purpose, dynamically manipulating the HTML DOM in the browser.\\
At the same time a company called Sun worked on a programming language called Java, Netscape and Sun decided to work together and followed the idea of making LiveScript using Java Applets.  Netscape noticed that it would be good marketing to rename LiveScript to \gls{JS}. Since Java already had a growing community and was liked by many people, so Netscape took the chance and \gls{JS} was born.

However both language don't share a lot of things together, Java is a normal, static, and highly typed programming language, it runs on a virtual machine and needs to be compiled, whereas the single threaded \gls{JS} only runs in the browser and is script. Nevertheless they share the C related syntax and some similarities regarding naming conventions, both support object oriented programming.

The following analysis shall show why Java Script is in many ways superior for web development. Jeff Attwood the co-founder of the  computer programming question-and-answer website Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange once said "Any application that can be written in \gls{JS}, will eventually be written in JavaScript". \cite{HistoryJS1} \cite{HistoryJS2} \cite{HistoryJS3}

\subsection{JavaScript Distributed Architectures}
Most modern web designs rely on they three-tier architecture. On the server side computing is done and data is stored in databases. The client fetches data from  server and makes it accessible. Often the user is able to change the data on client side. 

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{bilder/grundlagen/Three-Tier.png}

	\label{fig:JS}
\end{figure}

For example deleting or adding a user, a request is sent to the server and a database change is done. For client side it facto mandatory to use \gls{JS}, but on server side  a large spectrum of languages is available, Java, CSharp, PHP, Ruby these are just the most famous one.

Once a user is added on client side, code is needed there in JavaScript. Same action needs to be implemented in a different language on server, 
therefore a second implementation is needed for the same action.
But the JavaScript ecosystem is undergoing rapid growth, with Node.js \gls{JS} is coming to the server and developers are now able to do whole applications in \gls{JS}.

That's big step, distributed systems that can use shared modules. It even affects the job market, front-end developers and back-end developers have been two separated jobs for over decades but now are one. People do not need to learn two languages anymore if they want to do full-stack web development, everything is covered with JavaScript.

\subsection{Multi-Platform Support}

Deploying an application for the web browser is only one aspect of modern web development, often a separate implementation is needed for mobile devices or even desktop implementations. Two major operating systems are currently dominating the smart-phone market Android and IOS. 

Both support native App developing but that brings back the problem of having to implement the same functionality twice. Sure smart-phone Apps are different from browser based applications, starting with the touch event and ending up with totally different layouts. 

With JavaScript developers can take advantage of modern frameworks like React Native or Electron, which give the possibility to code in \gls{JS}, the JavaScript is communicating natively with implemented components written in Java on Android, Objective C on iOS, CSharp on Windows via an abstraction called bridge. Everytime \gls{JS} is called it forwards the call to the native code implementation, the response is passed back to the implemented abstraction \gls{JS}.

\subsection{Single Threading and Concurrency}
The single treaded paradigm and non blocking architecture \gls{JS} is bond to, can be considered a weakness. Developing with JavaScript will generate errors and behavior that is perplexing . This section is about analyzing why \gls{JS} is relying on single threading and how it is still possible to add concurrency.

\gls{JS} was developed to manipulate the DOM, the DOM is a limited resource. Executing two pieces of code, asynchronously changing the same part of DOM would not be good. Given this single purpose it was decided to make JavaScript single threaded.

Actions that do not change the DOM should be able to run asynchronously. That makes sense, since fetching data from the server or reading a large list of files can take a lot of time and would block the browser, buttons would not be clickable anymore and any rendering would stop. 

How is it possible that JavaScript offers the opportunity to run code concurrently, even though it is single threaded? The following example how multi-threading is implemented in JavaScript.

Every time a function in \gls{JS} is called, it is put on the call stack. The result of that function is popped out from stack. The functions on stack are executed synchronously one after another.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{bilder/grundlagen/CallStack.png}
	\caption{Github Repositories sorted after used language} source:\cite{JS}
	\label{fig:JS}
\end{figure}

To execute code concurrently JavaScript needs to call the Web API, provided by the browser. The web browser is written in C++, so it fully supports multi-threading.

The Web API is called with a function that needs to be executed and a callback.
The callback tells what to do after the asynchronous function finished executing. It is mandatory to provide a callback with each asynchronous function.

Once the thread finished executing it passes the callback to as so called Callback Que. The Callback Que is a simple list with all callbacks that need to be executed. 

Further an event loop is responsible for checking if current stack is empty, if that's the case, the callback is put on stack and executed synchronously. The decoupling of the caller from the response allows for JavaScript to do other things while waiting for asynchronous operations to complete and their callbacks to fire.

\subsection{Functional Programming Paradigm}
There is no need to use functional programming in JavaScript, since this is more a philosophy question and definitely nothing somebody needs to do when programming in JavaScript.Other ways of coding, like object oriented programming, are supported in JavaScript as well. This section shall explain what functional programming is and how it is implemented in JavaScript. No global variables or states are used in functional programming, the output of a function only depends on the input arguments.

\end{figure}

Another concept is the use of high-order functions. Giving the possibility to use functions as inputs and outputs.

Data mutation shall be avoided.
