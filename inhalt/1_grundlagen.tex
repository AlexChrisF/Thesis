\section{JavaScript}
JavaScript first appeared in 1995, originally developed at Netscape by Brendan Eich it had a simple purpose, dynamically manipulating the HTML DOM in the browser. At the same time a company called Sun worked on a programming language called Java, Netscape and Sun decided to work together. Netscape noticed that it would be good marketing to rename LiveScript to JavaScript. Since Java already had a growing community and was liked by many people, so Netscape took the chance and JavaScript was born. However both language don't share a lot of things together, Java is a normal, static, and highly typed programming language, it runs on a virtual machine and needs to be compiled, whereas the single threaded JavaScript only runs in the browser and is script. Nevertheless they share the C related syntax and some similarities regarding naming conventions, both support object oriented programming.Today JavaScript is the most used programming language world wide. Jeff Attwood the co-founder of the  computer programming question-and-answer website Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange once said "Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript".
