\section{JavaScript}
There are a few big advantages offered by \textbf{\gls{JS}}. Maybe the biggest advantage is that it comes with the web browser, so everybody can run it by simply typing in an \gls{URL}. This offers great possibilities, since the users don't have to install any software package. The provided application is immediately ready to use once it was loaded. Today \gls{JS} is the most used programming language world wide (Picture: \ref{fig:JS}). \gls{JS} first appeared in 1995, originally developed at Netscape by Brendan Eich it had a simple purpose, dynamically manipulating the HTML DOM in the browser. At the same time a company called Sun worked on a programming language called Java, Netscape and Sun decided to work together. Netscape noticed that it would be good marketing to rename LiveScript to \gls{JS}. Since Java already had a growing community and was liked by many people, so Netscape took the chance and \gls{JS} was born. However both language don't share a lot of things together, Java is a normal, static, and highly typed programming language, it runs on a virtual machine and needs to be compiled, whereas the single threaded \gls{JS} only runs in the browser and is script. Nevertheless they share the C related syntax and some similarities regarding naming conventions, both support object oriented programming.The following analysis shall show why Java Script is in many ways superior for web development. Jeff Attwood the co-founder of the  computer programming question-and-answer website Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange once said "Any application that can be written in \gls{JS}, will eventually be written in JavaScript". \cite{HistoryJS1} \cite{HistoryJS2} \cite{HistoryJS3}

\subsection{JavaScript Distributed Architectures}
Most modern web designs rely on they three-tier architecture. On the server side computing is done and data is stored in databases. The client fetches the data from the server and displays it. Often the user is able to change the data on the client side. For example deleting or adding a user, a request is sent to the server and a database change is done. For client side it is mandatory to use \gls{JS}, but on server side  a great spectrum of languages is available, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby and that are just the most famous one. Once a user is added on client side, code is needed there in JavaScript and same action needs to be implemented in a different language on server, therefore one needs to provide duplicated code. But the JavaScript ecosystem is undergoing rapid growth, with Node.js \gls{JS} is coming to the server and developers are now able to do whole applications in \gls{JS}. That's huge step, distributed systems that can use shared modules. It even affects the job market, front-end developers and back-end developers have been two separated jobs for over decades but now are one. People do not need to learn two languages anymore if they want to do full-stack web development everything is covered with JavaScript.
