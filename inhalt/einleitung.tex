\chapter{Motivation}

These days a lot of data is generated to improve the way we use our cars or to unlock our phones, autonomous driving and face recognition are only two examples where we need a lot of data to improve algorithms and with that the devices we use that algorithms for. 

But the maybe most interesting area where a lot of data is collected is health care. Modern technologies give us possibilities we never had before, artificial intelligence makes it possible to determine if one has a malignant melanoma or just a harmless mole with your cellphone. 

However there is still a lot of high potential data unused, one reason for that is most people don't know how to use the data they have. It seems to be a privilege to Computer Scientists and Computer Enthusiasts to take advantage of that data and the potential it holds. 

Imagine biologists and doctors going through Hundreds and Thousands of samples, giving them a tool to automatize there daily work flow would be a huge ease.

Goal of this bachelor thesis is to evaluate on how to give normal users, users without knowledge of how to install a Python environment or dealing with databases, the possibility to use all advantages of machine learning.By that this projects somehow follows the modest aim to democratize artificial intelligence.
